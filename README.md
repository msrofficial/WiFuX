          # WiFuX - WiFi Hacker Tool

**WiFuX** is a Python-based tool designed for testing the security of wireless networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) protocol. It includes various features such as Pixie Dust attacks, brute-force attacks, and support for multiple WPS PIN generation algorithms.

This project is intended for educational purposes and ethical use only. Always ensure you have proper authorization before using this tool on any network.

## üîß Features

- **WPS PIN Generation**: Supports multiple algorithms to generate potential WPS PINs based on MAC addresses.
- **Pixie Dust Attack**: Integration with `pixiewps` for offline brute-forcing of WPS PINs using captured EAP messages.
- **Online Brute-force Attack**: Online brute-force attack capabilities for guessing WPS PINs.
- **Network Scanner**: Built-in scanner to detect nearby WPS-enabled networks and display detailed information.
- **Session Management**: Saves progress during brute-force sessions for resuming later.
- **Credential Storage**: Stores successfully recovered credentials into text and CSV files.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Highlights known vulnerable devices from a custom list.
